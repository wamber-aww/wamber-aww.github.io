## About this blog

This website primarily contains data science projects and minimum personal blogs. The projects include data visualization and analysis on interesting datasets. However, they are by no means comprehensive or meant to be published academically. Hence the title, *Data Science Playground*, where I play around with data and write about interesting (or uninteresting) conclusions.

The contents of this website are organized into tabs that can be found on the top-right corner

 - About: this post

 - Sitemap: a list of all posts and pages found on this blog

The construct of this blog is based on 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) 
and
[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)
with some customizations. All codes used on this website can be found in my
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/wamber-aww/wamber-aww.github.io). 
I am still actively developing this website so please feel free to leave comments!

## About me

I am a fourth-year Pharmacology PhD student in the Department of Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania. My thesis focuses on using novel genomic and epigenomic approaches with next-generation sequencing techniques to identify novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers for diabetes and liver diseases. In layman's term, I work on using big data to treat human diseases. 

I started out grad school as a wet lab researcher - yes, the biologist in a white coat who always gets eaten first by aliens, while the engineer builds deadly weapons to protect humans. I'm not sure how much this actually played into my transition into dry lab, but over the past three years, I slowly moved into the bioinformatics field, and now over 80% of my work is done via programming.

All jokes aside, I still enjoy being a bench scientist as much as being a bioinformatician. I'm also extremely grateful to have the opportunity to learn both equally-important skills, so that I can analyze my own sequencing data and at the same time be thankful for the not always perfect data. 

Since I don't consider myself as a traditionally-trained computational biologist, I'm actively taking MOOCS and seeking projects to get more exposure on data science. Please find my contact information on the sidebar and I welcome any feedback!

## Final notes

As described above, my contact information can be found on the sidebar. The easiest way to get to me is probably through [email](mailto:wamberw1011@gmail.com). I'm also an open-networker on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aw-amberwang)
so feel free to connect with me. My [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9ZS_BDYAAAAJ&hl=en)
page contains a (very short) list of my publications for anyone who is interested in some serious reading.

Finally, I would like to thank my rescue dog Mochi for bringing so much love and joy into my life. I have attached her 
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mochinfriends/)
for all the animal-lovers out there to admire her beauty and laugh at her silliness.
