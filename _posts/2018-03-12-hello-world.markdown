After struggling with Jekyll for a couple of weeks, I'm so excited to finally have my first hello world blog post! This has been one of my new year's resolution and I'm really glad to be able to reach this goal.

Anyways, I'm psyched to share the data science projects that I've been working on, and hope you'll find them interesting too! As always, please feel free to leave any comments. 

Finally, here's a picture of my dog Mochi excited about learning new things (because she gets treats). She's my role model in always being open and happy to learn new tricks ;)
